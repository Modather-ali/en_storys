Cody and his sister April decide they want a dog. They head down to the local pet store and have a look around.



It is a very small pet store that doesn't have many animals.



The owner of the shop is a nice old man named Mr. Smith. He walks over and greets Cody and April.



"How can I help you?" he asks.   



"We would like to buy a dog," April responds.



"Ah, well, we are not a big pet shop," Mr. Smith tells her. "So we only have two dogs to choose from."



They ask Mr. Smith to show them the dogs.



Mr. Smith leads them to the back of store where the two dogs are. One of them is a very big bulldog named Buster. The other is a very tiny chihuahua named Teacup.



April wants Teacup. Cody wants Buster. They walk outside to discuss.



They can’t agree on a dog. April suggests they race home for it. The winner of the race chooses the dog.



Cody agrees, then tells April her shoelace is untied. When April looks down, he runs off and gets a head start.



Cody runs as hard as he can. He really wants that bulldog. He looks back. April is so far behind he can’t even see her.



Cody finally gets home. He is tired but he is happy. He knows he is the winner.



April arrives a few minutes after Cody. She congratulates him. They return to the pet store to purchase Buster the bulldog.



However, when they arrive they only see Teacup the chihuahua.

They ask Mr. Smith where Buster is.



Mr. Smith gives the details. He explains that a few minutes after April and Cody leave, two boys walk in and buy the bulldog.



Cody looks at April, and she holds back a smile. Cody sighs. He turns back to Mr. Smith.



"Sometimes you win the race, but not the prize!" Cody smiles sadly. "We’ll take the chihuahua, please."

Chloe and Kevin enjoy going out to Italian restaurants.



They love to eat pasta, share a dessert, and have espresso.



Chloe and Kevin’s anniversary is coming up. Kevin wants to plan a night out at an Italian restaurant in town. He calls a restaurant to make a reservation but they have no tables available. He calls another restaurant, but they have no availability either.



Kevin thinks and paces around the house. He knows that Chloe loves Italian food more than anything else. He knows that nothing makes her happier. But the only two Italian places in town are too busy.



Kevin has an idea. What if he cooks Chloe a homemade Italian meal? Kevin pictures it: he puts down a fancy tablecloth, lights some candles, and plays romantic Italian music. Chloe loves when Kevin makes an effort.



There's only one thing. Kevin isn't a good cook.



In fact, Kevin is a terrible cook. When he tries to make breakfast he burns the eggs, when he tries to make lunch he screws up the salad, when he tries to make dinner even the neighbors smell how bad it is.



Kevin has another idea: if he calls up one of the restaurants before Chloe gets home and orders take-out, he can serve that food instead of his bad cooking!



The day arrives. Chloe is still at work while Kevin orders the food, picks it up, and brings it back home.



As he lays down the place settings, lights the candles and puts the music on, Chloe walks in.



"Happy Anniversary!" Kevin tells Chloe. He shows off their romantic dinner setting, smiling.



Chloe looks confused. "Our anniversary is tomorrow, Kevin."



Kevin pauses, looks at the calendar and realizes she's right. He looks back at her.



"I guess it's always good to practice!" he says.

The basketball players are looking at each other, a little confused.

Suddenly, more than a few of the players are laughing at the coach.

In a small village, there lived a potter. He had a donkey. Everyday his donkey would carry soil from the field to his house. Since the field was quite far off, the potter would rest under a tree midway, tying his donkey nearby.



One day, the potter forgot to take the rope with which he tied the donkey everyday. When he reached the tree, he thought, “How do I tie this donkey today? He might run away if I sleep. “The potter decided to tie down holding the donkey’s ears so that the donkey would not run away.



But this way neither the donkey was comfortable nor the potter was able to take rest. A saint, who happened to be passing by, saw the potter holding on to the donkey’s ears. Then the saint wanted to know what the problem of the potter was. When the potter told the saint what the problem was, the wise saint said, “Take the donkey to the place where you tie him everyday. Pretend to tie him using an imaginary rope. I assure you he won’t run away." The potter did what the saint had said.



He left the donkey and went to take a nap. When he woke up, to his surprise and relief, he found the donkey standing in the same place.



Soon the potter prepared to leave for home. But the donkey did not move. “What is wrong with this donkey!" exclaimed the potter in frustration.



Luckily, the potter saw the wise saint again. He ran up to the saint and told him about the donkey’s strange behavior. The saint said, “You tied up the donkey, but did you untie him?" Go and pretend to untie the rope with which you had tied the donkey." The potter followed the saint’s advice.



Now the donkey was ready to leave for home. The potter understood that donkey was the bonded donkey. The potter thanked the wise saint and went home happily with his donkey.

The man sticks out his hand and says, "Hi, I’m Paul."



"Hi, I’m Penny," Penny says. "Are we related?"



Paul laughs. "No, we are not related. I am Vernon's nurse. He is sick and needs to keep me close by. But he did not want to miss this barbeque!"



"Oh, thank goodness," Penny says and then blushes. Penny always blushes when she is nervous, embarrassed, or hot, and right now she is all three.



Handsome Paul laughs and says, "Would you like to go get a hamburger with me? They smell delicious."



Penny smiles, "Sure. I love hamburgers!"

Once there was a rich man in Thailand. His name was Chulong. He was a very rich man. Yet he wanted more riches, more money.



One day he was walking in his garden. He saw a strange bird in a bush. It was very small. But it had very beautiful and colorful features. Its voice was also very sweet. Chulong had never seen such a bird in his life. He slowly went near the bush unseen. He caught the bird. Now the bird began to speak.



“Why have you caught me?" the bird asked.



“I want to make money. I can sell you for a big amount," replied Chulong.



“But you are already rich. Why do you want more?" asked the bird.



“Because I want to become richer and richer," replied Chulong.



“But do not dream of making money through me!" said the bird. It further added, “You can not sell me. Nobody will buy me, because, in imprisonment, I lose my beauty and my sweet voice." Then it slowly turned into a black bird.



The beautiful features were now looking like the feathers of a crow.



Chulong hopes of making money were shattered. He said angrily, “I will kill you, and I will eat your meat."



“Eat me! I am so small. You will not get any meat out of me," replied the bird.



Chulong could not answer. The bird then suggested, “Well set me free. In return I shall teach you three simple but useful rules."



“What is the use of the rules? I want only money," said Chulong. He was irritated.



“But these rules can profit you greatly," added the bird.



“Profit me! Really? Then I shall set you free. But how can I trust you? You may fly away," said Chulong.



“I give you my word. And I always keep my word," said the bird.



Chulong wanted to take a chance. He released the bird. It flew up at once. Then it sat on the branch of a tree. Its color started changing. It became beautiful again.



Chulong asked, “Now teach me the rules."



“Certainly," said the bird.



Then it added, “The first rule is Never Believe everything others say. The second rule is Never be sad about something you do not have. The third rule is Never throw away what you have in your hand."



“You silly bird," shouted Chulong. And he added, “These three rules are known to every one. You have cheated me."



But the bird said, “Chulong, just sit down for a while. Think about all your actions of today. You had me in your hands, but you threw me away (released me). You believed all that I said. And you are sad about not having me. The rules are simple. But you never followed them. Now do you see the value of the rules?" so saying the bird flew away and disappeared from his sight.

Once upon a time there lived a crow. She had built her nest on a tree. At the root of the same tree, a snake had built its home.



Whenever the crow laid eggs, the snake would eat them up. The crow felt helpless. “That evil snake. I must do something. Let me go and talk to him," thought the crow.



The next morning, the crow went to the snake and said politely, “Please spare my eggs, dear friend. Let us live like good neighbors and not disturb each other."



“Huh! You cannot expect me to go hungry. Eggs are what I eat," replied the snake, in a nasty tone.



The crow felt angry and she thought, “I must teach that snake a lesson."



The very next day, the crow was flying over the King’s palace. She saw the Princess wearing an expensive necklace. Suddenly a thought flashed in her mind and she swooped down, picked up the necklace in her beak and flew off to her nest.



When the Princess saw the crow flying off with her necklace, she screamed, “Somebody help, the crow has taken my necklace."



Soon the palace guards were running around in search of the necklace. Within a short time the guards found the crow. She still sat with the necklace hanging from her beak.



The clever crow thought, “Now is the time to act." And she dropped the necklace, which fell right into the snake’s pit of house.



When the snake heard the noise, it came out of its pit of house. The palace guards saw the snake. “A snake! Kill it!" they shouted. With big sticks, they beat the snake and killed it.



Then the guards took the necklace and went back to the princess. The crow was happy, “Now my eggs will be safe," she thought and led a happy and peaceful life.

A washer man had a donkey and a dog. Both the donkey and the dog helped his master in many ways. One night, few thieves broke in the house of that washer man. The dog heard them and started barking. The washer man got up and so did the neighbors. “What is that? A dog. Let us run," said the thieves. They feared some dangerous consequences. By that time many people gathered in the street. They tried to run away but they were caught by the people.



The washer man said, “I am glad I had this dog in my house. I am sure the thieves would have looted me if my dog had not barked." The washer man was highly proud of the dog. Every one too praised the dog.



From that day, the donkey started thinking, “The master thinks that the dog is a more useful animal than me." The donkey decided he will show his master, the washer man, that he too could be useful just like the dog. Few days passed. One night, it so happened, two thieves again entered the washer man’s house. The thieves became aware of the animals, present in that house. “We should be careful, friend! I have heard that a dog guards this house," one thief said to the other.



As the thieves peeped in, they saw the dog sitting just outside the main door. “It seems the dog is quite alert," said one thief.



“It is better to leave this house alone. We had better go at once," the other thief said and the two thieves fled. But unknown to the thieves, the donkey was watching all this. He thought, “It is a good opportunity for me to show my master that I too can be useful to him. The thieves have run away. If I start shouting, the master will think that I have driven the thieves away and out of this house." And the foolish donkey started braying loudly.



When the washer man heard the donkey bray at this odd hour, he got angry. He came out with a stick and thrashed the donkey. “This will teach him not to bray at night," he screamed. The donkey got all the thrashes in silence. It did not know what was taking place.



Just then the dog came to the donkey and said, “It is better to do your duties than try to be like me." The donkey knew that the dog was right.There after both the donkey and the dog remained peaceful.

In a huge pond, there lived many fish. They were arrogant and never listened to anyone. In this pond, there also lived a kind-hearted crocodile.



He advised the fish, “It does not pay to be arrogant and overconfident. It could be your downfall." But the fish never listened to him. “There is that crocodile, advising us again," they would say.



One afternoon, the crocodile was resting beside a stone near the pond, when two fishermen stopped there to drink water.



The fishermen noticed that the pond had many fish. “Look! This pond is full of fish. Let’s come here tomorrow with our fishing net," said one of them. “I am surprised we have not seen this place before!" exclaimed the other.



The crocodile heard all this. When the fishermen left, he slowly slipped into the pond and went straight to the fish. “You all had better leave this pond before dawn. Early morning those two fishermen are going to come to this pond with their net," warned the crocodile.



But the fish just laughed and said, “There have been many fishermen who have tried to catch us. These two are not going to catch us either. Do not you worry about us, Mr. Crocodile," they said in a mocking voice.



The next morning, the fishermen came and threw their net in the pond. The nets were big and strong. Very soon all the fish were caught. “If only we had listened to Mr. Crocodile. He had only wanted to help. For our arrogance we have to pay with our lives," said the fish.



The fishermen took the foolish fish to the market and sold them for a good profit.

Ali and Abraham were brothers. Their mother died very early. Their father also died after some time. He left for his sons a cow and a date-tree.



Ali was cunning. He was greedy too. Abraham was kind and honest. He trusted his elder brother. They wanted to divide their father’s property. Ali said, “I will be very fair with you, Abraham. You take the front portion of the cow as your share. I will take the hind side of the cow. Each one gets his profit only from his share." In the same way the tree was also divided. The upper part of the tree went to Ali. And the lower part of the tree went to Abraham.



Abraham fed the cow very well fresh grass and water. The cow became healthy. It gave lot of milk. Ali got the milk. He sold the milk and got a lot of money. But he did not hare the money with Abraham. Abraham asked his brother about his share of money. Ali replied, “I got the milk from my portion of our cow. Hind part is mine as per the agreement. Each of us gets the benefits only from his part." Abraham said nothing.



A wise man advised Abraham. He said some thing in the ear of Abraham. The next day Ali was milking the cow. Then Abraham beat the cow in the front portion. The cow started kicking. Ali shouted at Abraham. “You fool! Why do you beat the cow? Do not see me milking the cow?"



“The front portion of the cow is mine. I can do anything. That is our agreement," said Abraham.



Ali could not say anything. Finally he agreed to share the money. Abraham said, “Not just money. You must also share the work of feeding and taking care of the cow too." Ali agreed.



With regard to the tree, Ali had taken upper part of the tree. He made holes on the upper part of the tree. A kind of sweet-smelling juice came out of these holes. The juice was collected in pots. These pots were kept near the holes. Ali sold the juice for money. But he did not share either the money or the juice with his brother.



Again the wise man advised Abraham. The next day Ali was on the top of the tree. He was fixing pots near the holes. At that time Abraham was cutting the lower part of the tree. Ali shouted at Abraham. But Abraham reminded Ali about the agreement. He said, “I can do anything with my part. You can not question or stop me."



Ali now realized his mistakes. He said, “Abraham, I have been a bad brother to you. I feel ashamed of my selfishness. I ask your pardon. I promise to look after you well hereafter."



And so he did. Both the brothers lived happily. They shared the profit.

Haria, a poor barber lived alone in his small hut. He was dedicated to his work. And whatever he earns was enough to fulfill his needs.







One evening, after returning from work, Haria was hungry. “What shall I cook tonight?" he thought. Just then he heard a hen clucking outside his hut. “That hen would make a great feast for me," thought Haria and prepared to catch the hen.







With a little effort he was able to catch the hen. As he was about to kill the hen, it squeaked, “Please do not kill me, O kind man! I will help you." Haria stopped. Though he was surprised that the hen spoke, he asked, “How can you help me?"







“If you spare my life, I will lay a golden egg everyday for you," said the hen. Haria’s eyes got widened in delight. Haria was surprised to hear this promise. “A golden egg! That too everyday! But why should I believe you? You might be lying," said Haria. “If I do not lay a golden egg tomorrow, you can kill me," said the hen. After this promise, Haria spared the hen and waited for the next day.







The next morning, Haria found a golden egg lying outside his hut and the hen sitting beside it. “It is true! You really can lay a golden egg!" exclaimed Haria with great delight. He did not reveal this incident to any one, fearing that others would catch the hen.







From that day onwards, the hen would lay a golden egg everyday. In return, Haria took good care of the hen. Very soon, Haria became rich.







But he became greedy. He thought, “If I cut open the hen’s stomach, I can get out all the golden eggs at once. I do not have to wait for the hen to lay the golden eggs one by one."







That night, he brought the hen to the interior portion of his house and killed the hen. But to his dismay, he found no golden eggs. Not even one.







“What have I done? My greed had made me kill the hen," he wailed. But it was too late.
